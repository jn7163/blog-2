Blog
----

New static blog implementation.

WHY I rewrite my blog?
======================

The previous version of my blog was build from scratch, by using Bootstrap_, Flask_ and MongoDB_. It took me about 2 weeks to build it, but it was not as perfect as I expected. I do not want to spend too much time on fixing bugs of front-end pages. I want to focus on writing articles.

.. _Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _MongoDB: http://www.mongodb.org/

Dependences
===========

* Python 3.3.x

* Pelican_

.. _Pelican: http://docs.getpelican.com/
